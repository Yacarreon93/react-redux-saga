# Async React with Redux Saga

In this course we are going to take an empty React and Redux application and add Redux Saga side effects. We’ll begin by installing saga to the app and implement a basic saga generator function. We’ll explore the saga commands provided by Redux Saga and what the difference is between blocking and non-blocking actions.

We will also understand how to concurrently run sagas with saga helpers and how we wire everything up with the Redux store. Finally, we’ll finish up by implementing tests for our sagas.
